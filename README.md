In this section I will list data analytics projects I have worked on.

## Analyzing Factors Affecting E-Commerce Sales and Profitability ##

**Code:** [E-Commerce Sales Analysis.ipynb](E-Commerce.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze various factors affecting sales, profit, and customer behavior in the e-commerce dataset.

**Description:**  This project analyzes a dataset of e-commerce transactions to uncover insights into sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior. The dataset includes features like product categories, discounts, shipping costs, and order priorities. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation studies, and hypothesis testing.

**Skills**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** The analysis revealed that Shipping Cost has a strong positive correlation with Profit, suggesting that higher shipping costs are associated with higher profits. Discounts showed a weak positive correlation with Sales, but had no significant impact on Profit. Additionally, Medium Priority orders generated more profit than High Priority orders.
